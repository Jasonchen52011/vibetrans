    "The first IVR system capable of speech recognition was built in 1984 and could understand a vocabulary of … 10 words.",
    "About 30% of callers abandon a call if the IVR does not greet them in their native language within the first 15 seconds.",
    "Some airlines maintain over 40 language versions of the same IVR tree; the Indonesian version is usually the longest because of politeness prefixes.",
    "ITU-T standard G.711 (from 1972) still defines the audio format used by most IVR prompts today.",
    "Neural TTS voices can be generated in under 200 ms—faster than a human can blink—making real-time IVR translation technically feasible."

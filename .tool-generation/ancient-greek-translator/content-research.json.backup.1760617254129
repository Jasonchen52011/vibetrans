    "Ancient Greek had no dedicated word for 'translator'; the closest term διερμηνεύς means 'interpreter' and appears mainly for spoken mediation.",

    "Unicode allocates an entire 'Greek Extended' block (1F00–1FFF) just to capture Ancient Greek accents and breathings.",
    "The first computer attempt to translate Ancient Greek dates back to 1964 at the University of Texas, decades before Google Translate.",
    "Because Ancient Greek is highly inflected, the single verb ἐφιλέησεν contains information equivalent to the English phrase 'he kept loving'."

          "alt": "Haitian Creole: 'Mwen renmen manje bannann fri ak pwa kole'\n\nEnglish: 'Users love eating fried plantains with red beans and rice'\n\nExplanation: This translation captures Haitian cuisine terminology. 'Mwen' (I) uses Creole's simplified pronoun system. 'Renmen' (love) comes from French 'aimer'. 'Bannann fri' directly translates plantain + fried, showing Creole's straightforward compound structure. 'Pwa kole' (literally 'beans stuck') is the cultural term for the national dish of rice and beans cooked together.",

          "alt": "Jamaican Patois: 'Mi cyaan believe seh di bus lef widout mi'\n\nEnglish: 'I can't believe that the bus left without me'\n\nExplanation: This demonstrates Jamaican Patois phonology and grammar. 'Mi' replaces English 'I/me'. 'Cyaan' represents the characteristic pronunciation of 'can't'. 'Seh' (that) is a complementizer from English 'say'. 'Di' is the definite article. 'Lef' shows consonant cluster reduction from 'left'. 'Widout' maintains the Patois pronunciation pattern.",

          "alt": "Haitian Creole: 'Nou bezwen travay ansanm pou nou rive nan objektif la'\n\nEnglish: 'We need to work together to reach the goal'\n\nExplanation: This formal business phrase shows Creole's structure. 'Nou' serves as both 'we' and 'us'. 'Bezwen' (need) derives from French 'besoin'. The infinitive 'travay' (work) requires no conjugation marker. 'Ansanm' (together) is one word. 'Pou nou rive' (for us arrive) expresses purpose. The definite article 'la' comes after the noun 'objektif', following Creole's postposed article pattern.",

          "alt": "Jamaican Patois: 'Weh yuh deh? Mi deh a yaad a wait pan yuh'\n\nEnglish: 'Where are you? I'm at home waiting for you'\n\nExplanation: This casual message uses typical Patois constructions. 'Weh yuh deh' combines 'where' + 'you' + progressive marker 'deh'. 'Mi deh' indicates present continuous (I am). 'A yaad' means 'at home' (from 'yard'). The second 'a' is the progressive marker before 'wait'. 'Pan' represents 'upon/for' in Patois phonology. This shows how Patois creates continuous aspect differently from English.",

          "alt": "Haitian Creole: 'Timoun yo bezwen ale lekòl pou yo aprann'\n\nEnglish: 'The children need to go to school so they can learn'\n\nExplanation: This educational sentence demonstrates Creole plural marking. 'Timoun' (child/children) is number-neutral; 'yo' after it marks plurality (the children). 'Bezwen ale' (need go) uses bare infinitive. 'Lekòl' (school) merges French 'l'école'. The second 'yo' means 'they'. 'Pou yo aprann' (for them learn) expresses purpose using the subjunctive-like construction typical in Creole.",

          "alt": "Jamaican Patois: 'Every day mi wake up early an give thanks fi life'\n\nEnglish: 'Every day I wake up early and give thanks for life'\n\nExplanation: This reflective statement mixes Standard English words with Patois features. 'Mi' (I) is consistent Patois pronoun usage. 'Wake up' remains English. 'An' shows typical 'd' deletion from 'and'. 'Give thanks' is literal. 'Fi' is the Patois preposition meaning 'for', derived from 'for' but pronounced differently. This sentence exemplifies the Creole continuum where speakers code-switch between basilect (deep Creole) and acrolect (closer to English).",

          "description": "Creole languages developed when communities speaking different languages needed to communicate, typically during colonization and trade. Haitian Creole emerged from French and West African languages, while Jamaican Patois blends English with African linguistic features. These aren't 'broken' languages—they're fully-formed linguistic systems with consistent grammar rules, serving over 12 million speakers worldwide. Each Creole preserves African grammatical patterns while incorporating European vocabulary."

          "title": "Creole Grammar and Structure",
          "description": "Creole languages feature simplified but sophisticated grammar systems. Haitian Creole eliminates French verb conjugations, using particles to indicate tense (e.g., 'te' for past, 'ap' for present continuous). Jamaican Patois marks aspect differently than English, with 'a' indicating progressive action. Both use postposed definite articles and serial verb constructions from African languages. VibeTrans understands these structural differences, accurately translating temporal markers, aspect indicators, and articles. Word order tends to be SVO (Subject-Verb-Object), but flexibility exists for emphasis. Our AI recognizes these patterns and produces natural English equivalents."

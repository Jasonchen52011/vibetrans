          "description": "Cuneiform, invented by ancient Sumerians around 3200 BCE in Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq), is humanity's first known writing system. Originally developed for accounting and administrative records, it evolved over 3000 years to express complex literature, scientific observations, and legal codes. The word 'cuneiform' comes from Latin 'cuneus' (wedge), describing the characteristic wedge-shaped marks made by pressing a reed stylus into wet clay tablets."

        {
          "title": "Used Across Ancient Civilizations",
          "description": "Remarkably, cuneiform wasn't limited to one language or culture. Over its millennia-long history, at least 15 different ancient languages were written in cuneiform script, including Sumerian, Akkadian, Babylonian, Assyrian, Elamite, Hittite, and Urartian. This makes cuneiform somewhat like the Latin alphabet today—a writing system adapted by many cultures to record their own distinct languages. The Epic of Gilgamesh, one of humanity's oldest literary works, was written in Akkadian cuneiform."

        },
        "item-3": {
          "question": "What cuneiform scripts and dialects does VibeTrans support?",
          "answer": "VibeTrans supports three major ancient Mesopotamian languages: Sumerian (3200-2000 BCE, the oldest known written language), Akkadian (2500-100 BCE, Semitic language of Babylonian and Assyrian empires), and Babylonian (1895-539 BCE, administrative and literary dialect). Within these, the AI recognizes multiple historical dialects including Old Akkadian, Old Babylonian, Middle Babylonian, Neo-Babylonian, and Neo-Assyrian, applying appropriate grammatical rules and vocabulary for each period."
        },
        "item-4": {
          "question": "Can I translate from English to cuneiform script?",
          "answer": "Yes! VibeTrans supports bidirectional translation. You can translate from English to transliterated cuneiform and from cuneiform to English. When translating English to cuneiform, the AI converts your modern text into appropriate Sumerian, Akkadian, or Babylonian vocabulary and grammar, then provides standard academic transliteration. This feature is particularly useful for creating educational materials, comparative linguistics research, or understanding how ancient scribes would have expressed modern concepts."
        },
        "item-5": {
          "question": "How accurate is VibeTrans cuneiform translation compared to human experts?",
          "answer": "VibeTrans achieves approximately 75-85% accuracy for standard literary and administrative texts, based on comparison with published expert translations. Accuracy is highest for well-documented text types like legal codes, royal inscriptions, and literary works with extensive parallel texts. Accuracy decreases for fragmentary tablets, rare vocabulary, and highly poetic or metaphorical language. The tool is designed as a research accelerator rather than replacement for human expertise—it provides reliable preliminary translations that scholars should verify for publication-quality work."
        },
        "item-6": {
          "question": "Does VibeTrans work with cuneiform images or only transliteration?",
          "answer": "Currently, VibeTrans accepts transliterated cuneiform text (romanized representation using standard Assyriological conventions). We're developing optical character recognition (OCR) capabilities to process photographs and scans of actual cuneiform tablets, but this feature is still in beta testing. For now, users should input text using standard transliteration from published sources or personal transcription. Many online cuneiform databases like CDLI provide transliterated texts compatible with VibeTrans."

          "alt": "Albanian: 'Tavë kosi është një nga pjatat më të njohura tradicionale shqiptare'\n\nEnglish: 'Tavë kosi is one of the most famous traditional Albanian dishes'\n\nExplanation: This translation demonstrates proper handling of Albanian articles and superlatives. The definite article 'të' before 'njohura' (famous) is correctly rendered. The phrase 'pjatat tradicionale shqiptare' follows Albanian's adjective-after-noun structure, which we naturally reorder to English's adjective-before-noun pattern.",

'Të nderuar' (honored) uses the Albanian passive participle construction. The phrase 'partneritet të suksesshëm afatgjatë' demonstrates Albanian's postpositive definite article and compound adjective structure, which we preserve as 'successful long-term partnership' in English.",

'E veçantë' (unique) uses the feminine singular agreement marker 'e'. The relative clause 'që shtrihet për mijëra vjet' (that spans thousands of years) is correctly translated with the present tense verb form, maintaining the continuous aspect of Albanian.",

'Kthehuni' is the reflexive imperative form (turn yourself). The future construction 'do ta gjeni' combines the future particle 'do' with the clitic pronoun 'ta' and verb 'gjeni', translated as 'you will find'. Note how 'krahun e djathtë' (right side) uses the definite accusative case.",

You are always in our thoughts and hearts'\n\nExplanation: This emotional family message demonstrates Albanian's dative pronoun usage. 'Na mungoni' literally means 'you are lacking to us' but translates naturally as 'we miss you'. The subjunctive 'të vini' (that you come) after 'shpresojmë' (we hope) shows Albanian's subjunctive mood. The possessive 'tona' (our) agrees with the plural nouns 'mendimet dhe zemrat' (thoughts and hearts).",

The phrase 'trashëgimi kulturore të pasur' shows Albanian's postpositive adjective placement with definite article 'të'. The list of influences 'ilire, romake, bizantine dhe osmane' maintains parallel structure with Albanian's adjectival endings agreeing with the feminine plural 'ndikime' (influences).",
